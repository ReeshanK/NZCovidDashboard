Executive Summary

I have learnt how the combination of HTMl, CSS, Javascript and SVG can be used to create a valuable and informative website. I found that its possible to create visuals and graphs using SVG and making them responsive to some input from an API so that it dynamically updates whilst maintaining the look and feel of both the graph/visual and the webpage it is hosted on. One valuable piece of knowledge I know have is the use of SVG for resizeable images/icons that when resized, maintained the quality of the image/icon which was an issue when applying images of specific formats, sourced online. I was able to apply this learning to the COVID-19 application in this assignment, as there was a large dataset which would be provide more insight as graphs to gain better knowledge from the data than just to read it as records. I also learnt how given API or datasets will not always be clean data and when extracting and displaying this we must always account for discrepencies.   

In my reflection assignment, developing a COVID-19 dashboard I was able to approach this by first reviewing the data accessible and which bits of information I have available and concepting how this data would be best displayed. This process of reviewing and observing the data also helped in finding maximum values which would be appropriate for the graph scales. Within my COVID-19 dashboard I provided two sections of displays. Firstly, the total cases, total deaths and total recoveries clearly stated at the top with colour coding, providing an emotional impact when viewed. Secondly, two bar graphs displaying the daily cases and daily deaths since COVID-19 was first identified in New Zealand and also a third pie chart giving a visual understanding of the total recoveries, total deaths and active cases as a proportion of the total cases in New Zealand.
