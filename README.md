# NZCovidDashboard

As part of an assessment in Computer Science 335 in 2020. This dashboard uses an open-source API from disease.sh to gather data regarding the daily updates of new cases, deaths and recovered cases. I developed a single page dashboard application to display this information in an effective manner using figures and graphs created in SVG. This dashboard was developed using HTML and CSS for the basic front-end display along with SVG for displaying visuals and creating the graphs. While Javascript was used in back-end programming to extract data from the API to then be formatted and displayed appropriately. Disclaimer: The API provided had some inaccuracies with the data recorded, thus some of the daily cases and recoveries may not be 100% accurate.
